# Description
Consider a dart with 10 same centered circles whose diameters are evenly changing from 10 to 100 cm.
Assume that the worst shot is not outside the square inscribing the largest circle. Write a MATLAB script and find the probability of hitting
each of the point from zero (outside the largest circle) to
10 the smallest circle in the middle. The exact solution for each of the points is the ratio of the
area corresponded to that point to the area of the square.
